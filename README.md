LabFlow is an innovative application designed to track and manage laboratory samples in the field of Biomedical Laboratory Technology. As students graduate and begin working in labs, they encounter various samples, including blood, skin, and urine, which they analyze using complex devices. Currently, the only thing missing is a dedicated application for sample tracking.

### Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a sample tracking application that covers the following functionalities:

1. **Sample Registration**
    - Record the details of samples upon receipt.
    - Generate and print barcodes for easy identification.

2. **Sample Analysis**
    - Scan barcodes to retrieve sample information.
    - Input and manage analysis results.

3. **Result Feedback**
    - Print results alongside reference values for comparison.

This project encompasses more than just programming; it involves a complete analysis, including the creation of user stories, Figma prototypes, and decision-making regarding the technology stack (web vs application, database, programming language, etc.).

### Collaboration
The colleagues who will utilize this application work on our campus, allowing for a short feedback loop during analysis and development phases.
